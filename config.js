  finalMessage: `Hi Jayathi, if your on this page that means you accepted to be my valentine thought I couldn't be there with you in person definitely next year if you renew our relationship 😂 jk you can't escape easily so no take back because u already took my heart ❤️ 

It's true that you fell for me first but trust me I'm sure I fell harder for you. Everytime you text or I think about you it puts smile on me. 

I know we come from completely different perspectives. I don't know a lot (sometimes I'm not that good at picking things or if what I say makes sense lol) but I'm willing to be anything which requires because you are worth fighting for (Had to sneak this keanu's line in haha). I'm not coming with idea of a pefer scenarios or a movie poster couple, because the person i loved you as a whole not a version of you who is always cheery, playful and funny but also your other versions so what I care about is you I don't care if you call once in a while or we talk daily, just remember whatever the case at the other end I'm always willing to wait for you bangaram 🥰 because I know your doing what you can with things you can handle, I will do my best be honest and expressive which im really good at hope you understand so don't feel bad when you feel like ur not being there enough all i care about is if you think I'm important enough to keep me in you life. We talked right I'm the anchor your the sail.

Love you so much and I hope you have a great day and a great year ahead. Happy Valentine's Day!💖`,
