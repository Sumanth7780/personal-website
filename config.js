  finalMessage: `Hi Jayathi, if your on this page that means you accepted to be my valentine thought I couldn't be there with you in person definitely next year if you renew our relationship 😂 jk you can't escape easily so no take back because u already took my heart ❤️ 

It's true that you fell for me first but trust me I'm sure I fell harder for you. Everytime you text or I think about you it puts smile on me. You made me belive in love for the first time in my life. I know I'm not the best at expressing my feelings but I hope you can feel how much I care about you and how much I want to be with you.

I know we come from completely different perspectives. I don't know a lot (sometimes I'm not that good at picking things or if what I say makes sense lol) but I'm willing to be anything which requires because you are worth fighting for (Had to sneak this keanu's line in haha). I'm not coming with idea of a pefer scenarios or a movie poster couple, because the person i loved you as a whole not a version of you who is always crazy, playful, funny and disappearing most times haha just kidding but also your other versions i wanna be with every version of you so what I care about is you I don't care if you call once in a while or we talk daily, just remember whatever the case at the other end I'm always willing to wait for you bangaram 🥰 because I know your doing what you can with things you can handle, I will do my best be honest and im a pretty quick learner i will try to catch up, so don't feel bad when you feel like ur not being there enough all i care about is if you think I'm important enough to keep me in you life. We talked right I'm the anchor your the sail.

Love you so much and I hope you have a great day and a great year ahead. Happy Valentine's Day!💖

note: No AI this time, just me writing this for you, I hope you like it and I hope it makes you smile. I love you so much and I'm so grateful to have you in my life. You are the best thing that  happened to me and I will always cherish you. Happy Valentine's Day! 💝`,
