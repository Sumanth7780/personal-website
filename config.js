  finalMessage: `Hi Jayathi, if your on this page that means you accepted to be my valentine thought I couldn't be there with you in person definitely next year if you renew our relationship 😂 jk you can't escape easily so no take back because u already took my heart ❤️ 

It's true that you fell for me first but trust me I'm sure I fell harder for you. Everytime you text or I think about you it puts smile on me. 

I know we come from completely different perspectives. I'm not looking for trade I'm just looking for you and us, I don't know a lot (sometimes I'm not that good at picking things or if what I say makes sense lol) but I'm willing to be anything which requires because you are worth fighting for. I'm not coming with idea of a pefer scenarios or a movie couple, what I care about is you I don't care if you call once in a while or we talk daily, just remember whatever the case at the other end I'm always willing to wait for you bangaram 🥰 because I know your doing what you can with things you can handle, I will do my best. We talked right I'm the anchor your the sail.`,
